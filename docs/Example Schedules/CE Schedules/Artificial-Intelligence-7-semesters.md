# Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning, 7 Semesters

## About Me

I'm planning to graduate with a BS in Computer Engineering Spring of 2027. I'll probably continue on to grad school after that.
Follow me on linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayush-barik-5ab569183/.

## Features of this Schedule

The first couple of semesters can be done by anyone even if you don't plan on specializing in AI & ML so feel free to have a look. I'm
in James Scholar but I haven't done any honors coursework though they haven't kicked me out for some reason lol.

### 1st Semester, Freshman Year, Fall 2021
| **Course Name** | **Credit Hours** |
| --- | --- |

| **Total** | **16** |

Pretty chill semester, nothing crazy. MATH 285 was very chill gradewise, maybe sometimes it's annoying but fairly easy. Math 213 was awesome
because I was blessed with Michael Wigal - One of the professors of all time. Very funny guy, just became professor so his sanity is intact. He
has an Erd≈ës number of 2. ENG 100 and ENG 177 were whatever sometimes i would forget they exist - easy A though. REL 108 was nice, easy A because
you can redo the midterm. Reading heavy but interesting reads like The Leviathan and The Republic (Plato), some bible too. Eh there are probably
easier Gen Eds for fulfilling the Western requirement.

### 2nd Semester, Freshman Year, Spring 2022
| **Course Name** | **Credit Hours** |
| --- | --- |
| [ECE110 - Introduction to Electronics](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE110.md) | 3 |
| [ECE220 - Computer Systems and Programming](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE220.md) | 4 |
| [PHYS213 - University Physics: Thermal Physics](../../Course%20Wiki/PHYS%20Course%20Offerings/PHYS213.md) | 2 |
| [PHYS214 - University Physics: Quantum Physics](../../Course%20Wiki/PHYS%20Course%20Offerings/PHYS214.md) | 2 |
| [MATH257 - Linear Algebra with Computational Applications](../../Course%20Wiki/MATH%20Course%20Offerings/MATH257.md) | 3 | 
| ENG177 - GFX Career Scholars | 1 |
| **Total** | **15** |

Slightly less chill but I came out on top like always. ECE110 and PHYS213 is the freest classes imaginable (for me atleast). ECE 220 was kinda
annoying tbh, not that bad but very exam heavy class, also they messed up midterm 2 my sem. Phys 214 is aight still on the easier end of things.
I liked Math 257 even though everyone hates it, medium difficulty perhaps? Had to clutch up on final for an A. Did like an "internship" for ENG 177 with Pearl Jars but pretty useless and boring. 

### 3rd Semester, Sophomore Year, Fall 2022

| **Course Name** | **Credit Hours**|
| --- | --- |
| ENG 199 - URSA Program | 1 |
| ARTJ 301 - Manga: The Art of Image and Word | 3 |
| [CS225 - Data Structures](../../Course%20Wiki/CS%20Course%20Offerings/CS225.md)| 4 |
| [ECE210 - Analog Signal Processing](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE210.md) | 4 |
| [ECE313 - Probability with Engineering Applications](../../Course%20Wiki/ECE%20Course%20Offerings/ECE313.md) | 3 |
| **Total** | **15** |

Still in the process of doing this so idk. I have heard the horrors of ECE 210 and ECE 313 so we'll see. CS 225 doesn't teach any C++ but
220 did a decent job at teaching C++ tbh albeit pretty fast-paced. ARTJ 301 did not meet my expectations as a manga fan but still kinda good i guess? It fulfills the non-western gen ed requirement. I also joined the visionary Lin Hyouin in making Waifu Chatbots - that's the URSA research thing (ENG 199).

On track for a 7-semester graduation.
