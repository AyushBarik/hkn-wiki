# ECE395

ECE395 (Advanced Digital Projects Lab) is a 2/3-credit-hour course that is a technical elective for both CE and EE students. It is offered in both Fall and Spring.

## Content Covered
This is a class where you get to make anything you want... within reason. Keep in mind that you have to use a micro-controller/FPGA/Computer because it is a Digital Systems Lab, but let your imagination run wild.

These are some projects people have done in the past:

- Automatic Foosball Table (You can play foosball against a computer)
- Hydraulic Hexapod (six legged robot)
- Graphics Cards (from scratch)
- Tesla Coils
- IPad-Controlled Power Wheels (The small electric cars that toddlers can drive)
- Robots of all kinds (Arms, Hands, Battle bots, etc)

## Prerequisites

[ECE385](ECE385.md) is officially the only prerequisite, but many students motivated to pursue their own projects take ECE395 without credit in ECE385.


## When to Take It
Most students take this as a junior or senior. Exceptional sophomores can do well in this class too. Students who are fast and self sustaining learners, have experience with embedded systems (other than Arduinos), and have a good network of contacts that have knowledge in other fields, may be able to be successful in this class before taking [ECE385](ECE385.md).

## Course Structure

The workload varies, depending on what you choose to make. This is one of the most open classes in the entire college. You basically need to spend enough time to get things done.

## Instructors


This class has traditionally been taught by Professor Haken, who is known for his invention of the Continuum Fingerboard. His research is in computer music, so he is really great at embedded systems, DSP, programming and more! However, in more recent semesters, the class is now taught by Professor Smith, who since 2014 was the lab coordinator for the ECE department and prior worked at an Oregon-based hardware company called Opal Kelly, which was a hardware start-up when he joined, so he is a veteran of the product development cycle.

## Life After

This class prepares you for actual work and [ECE445](ECE445.md) (senior design). You get to work on a long term project with a deadline and you need to do whatever you can to meet that deadline and finish this. Students can really learn a lot in this class.
